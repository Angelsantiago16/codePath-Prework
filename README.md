## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
-I looked up online some functionalities when I did not know how something worked
-I also had some bugs so I looked up my error code on google to find its meaning 


2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

One challenge that I found during this project was that I don’t have previous experience with HTML or CSS however the guide was very helpful. Sometimes I had to look up how the syntax and how HTML and CSS worked, this helped me out with a lot.

On another note I also had bugs because I decided to make my own variable names, this was a problem because there were some functions in java script (light up) that strictly needed the buttons to be named button1,2,3,4. Because this Is a logic mistake, and the console was unable to find the right variable it took me long to solve this bug. At the end I managed to over this problem by taking a break and then analyzing the path the information took. I found out that the problem was I changed the variable names and fixed the issue 

Overall I really enjoyed this project, I learned a lot with it and now I feel more comfortable with web design.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

After completing this project I had many questions about we development. Mainly how to make the website look better, doing this project though me that there is a lot that goes into web development. However my background in back-end programming languages does help out understanding how everything works. 
I want to keep learning about web development so after completing this project I will keep researching and doing more web dev projects. I know there is other programming languages out there and I would like to explore them.


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had more time to work on this project, I would focus on adding some of the optional features and organizing my js functions. While I was making the project I keep having ideas that I thought would be a good feature as I checked the optional features I noticed that some of my ideas where optional features. The only reason I did not implement all the optional features is because of lack of time. However I had the idea of making this same game but with a piano key and make the player “guess” the song they are playing on the piano. If I had more time, I would love to implement this into the game and I still will try do this after submission.
